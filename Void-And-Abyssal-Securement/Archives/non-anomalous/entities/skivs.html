                Skivs
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reason for codename:</strong>
                I thought it sounded cool (Commented by Researcher 2408-IIs)

            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong>
                The Skivs are a highly intelligent terrestrial race. 
                They originate from a home planet outside our observable
                universe and are classified as 
                <a href="../../../NTK/intelligence-scales.html">severe*</a> 
                on our intelligence scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have a hood that hides most of their facial features, 
                however, they do have six eyes. One pair is for sight on the 
                visible light spectrum and one pair is assumed to be for sight 
                on the infrared spectrum. The last pair's purpose is unknown, 
                but due to the ship components, it's assumed they are psionic 
                in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have two sets of arms, which can regrow when removed. When 
                regrown, they are longer than the previous set of arms, however, 
                they never exceeed 5cm of extra length compared to the original. 
                The hands on the first set of arms are fixed in a downwards strike 
                posistion. This is most likely due to their combat style and the 
                position in which they hold their pike. The second set of arms is 
                not fixed in any position, and is opposable. The second set also 
                appears to be between 3 and 13 cm longer than the first set. Their 
                digits vary between 3 and 5 per hand. This number is seemingly 
                random, serves no purpose, and has no cause other than a highly 
                mutable gene. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Their body seems to have both an endoskeleton and exoskeleton. This 
                exoskeleton is flexible, like flesh. However, it appears to be as 
                strong and durable as hard iron. Their endoskeleton is harder and more 
                durable than EN24T steel.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Protocol:</strong>
                These entities are highly agressive 
                (<a href="../../../NTK/intelligence-scales.html"><em>due to their high intelligence</em></a>).
                It is imperative not to be within seeing distance of them. If you spot one,
                put its location on the Military Codex under P-1729. Pilot 1729 is actively 
                engaged in a war with these entities and is seeing victory over them. If you spot the Pilot,
                do not get near; it is usually in an area suspected of having UAE-01.

                <strong>Discovery:</strong>
                During a routine mission to Mars, the rocket was incinerated around 26km before atmospheric burnup should occur. 
                Three more (unmanned) attempts to study this  phenomenon occured. These attempts had an infrared probe watching 
                them. The area where the ships were entering was observed to have a temperature of 0K (absolute zero). This area 
                (dubbed "Null Area" later, due to the temperature extremes of the region) was approximately 16km in size. When 
                the ships entered the range of this area, the point of contact immediately spiked to a temperature of 5772K 
                (around the temperature of Sol's surface).
            </p>
            <p>
                This strange temperature anomaly was enough of an initiative for United Earth (pre-Terra) to reduce its military 
                funding to study it. Electronic based weaponry were deconstructed and then assembled into heating and freezing 
                rays to understand the effects of temperature change on the Null Area. The cooling rays were powered by a 
                cryotheum crystal, while the heating rays were powered by a pyrotheum crystal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The test of the heating rays resulted in a temperature rise to 5780K after 30 minutes of running. The test of the 
                cooling rays resulted in a temperature decline from 5780K to 5766K after 30 minutes of running. These results show 
                that A, the temperature of the area can be altered and B, cooling is more effective than heating.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cooling rays were replaced with more effective cryotheum crystals. A crystal of 465cm<sup>3</sup>
                of volume applied the same temperature change of 5 hours of continuous cooling ray fire (approximately a 
                temperature change of 60K). A mass driver was built on Luna near the cryotheum mine. It took years for the mass 
                driver's path to align properly. During this time, 16,684cm<sup>3</sup> (~40.6cm C 20.3cm X 20.3 cm) of cryotheum 
                was mined, coalesced, and loaded into the driver. After aligned, the payload was launched towards the Null Area.
            </p>
            <p>Upon contact with the area, the Infrared Probe recorded that the entirety of the Null Area flared up to 5766K 
                before being rapidly cooled down to 295K. This rapid temperature flux caused a massive Mass to Energy conversion. 
                The cataylst for this conversion was an explosion. This tore open the later-known hull of the ship. UE (<b>U</b>nited
                <b>E</b>arth) sent in scavenging fleets to recover the massive amount of material that had seemingly been created 
                from nothing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon arrival, the scavenging ships attempted to split larger metal shunks. After a quick atomic structure scan, 
                the material was determined to be a form of steel. The iron-carbon bonds were bonded to a great extent. The type
                of bonding that happened in the material only occurs from high temperatures. The temperatures required to make 
                the strong bonds in the material were greater than the core temperature of WR102 (an estimated 210,000K).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another squad of scavenging ships was sent, equipped with Arc Plasma Emitters. When the high-energy plasma 
                interacted with the chunks, a pulse was sent out, disabling the massive ship's cloaking technology. The ship's 
                dimensions match the Null Area's dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The immediate observation of the ship was the lack of external armaments, hinting they may have come in peace. 
                The more major observation point was that the ship's hull was repairing itself ata noticable rate. 
                (Automated repair finished approximately 245 Terran days after initial damage).
            </p>
            <p>
                A small communications vessel was sent out to accommodate the aliens on the misunderstanding that caused the 
                damage on their vessel. The communications team arrived on the alien ship expecting entities of any kind, however,
                they were greeted with silence. The only sounds that could be heard were the sounds of humming electricity coursing
                to the hull to form a barrering and the sounds of valve's hissing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The team wandered the hull before coming upon a terminal. On the terminal were what appeared to be two interface 
                buttons (this would be the only terminal on the ship with a interface capable of being touched). Upon pressing the 
                first button, the strange alien language in which the terminal was written in was changed to English (the common 
                tongue of UE). The button then disappeared, without enough time to understand what was written. The team then 
                switched their gaze to the second button. Written on it was "Adapt atmosphere". Upon activation, the hissing of 
                valves increased in power and frequency. A simple air constitution scan indicated that it was 78% Nitrogen and 21% 
                Oxygen; the atmosphere of Terra. High command ordered the team to not remove their helmets despite the air being
                presumable safe. This was a precaution due to have previously losing a colony on XOI-10 being lost due to an unknown 
                pathogen existing within the air. After 8 minutes the communications team was ordered to return, seeing as their were 
                no alien delegates to approach them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ship Exploration:</strong>
                The exploration group consisted of three teams of engineers, four teams of researchers, and one team of linguists. The
                engineer's job was to take apart the ship while the teams of researcher analyzed the parts. One team of researchers 
                discovered a life pod, containing a deceased Skiv. The pod was kept closed, and non-invasive biological scanners were 
                used to prevent alien diseases from contaminating the exploration crew. The mission for the team of linguists was to 
                decode and interpret the alien language. 
            </p>
            <p>
                An engineering team came across a communications array as well as a long that had not been sent. The linguists had only 
                achieved a basic understanding of the language so they could only partially translate the log. The main idea that was 
                gathered was simplified: "The ship was retreating from a planet, XZER-I12, during their civil war."
            </p>
            <p>
                The reasearch team arrived shortly after the initial discovery of the array. They began to research the technology 
                involved in its process of sending information. They discovered that despite their currently known laws of physics, the
                logs sent out by the array would arrive at their destination in exactly ten seconds without fail. This was due to the 
                technology creating a different timefield for the log to travel through ("Time is relative. Whatever that means"). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last engineering team discovered the room in which the aliens held their weaponry. It was discovered while they were
                deconstructing a seemingly dead end. Within the room they discovered large polearms. The shaft of each of them was made of
                stellar steel and the tips were made of either uranium or tungsten-titanium allogy. It took the combined efforts of all 
                three engineering teams to bring on weapon down from off the wall for deconstruction. Within the room, two teams of 
                researchers discovered what could be called "Psionic Panels". This supports the theory of their third pair of eyes being 
                for interaction in the psionic field. 
            </p>

                <strong>What is Star Seeding?</strong>
                Star seeding is considered a megaproject of forging. Stars are typically 99% the weight of a star system
                meaning that they have many resources that could be collected or forged together. Seeding involves dumping 
                large amounts of heavy elemnts into a star, Enrichment. When these enriched stars go Nova or Supernova, they
                release more heavy elements. The process can also be used for alloying materials, though much more difficult
                as it requires specific conditions to prevent the added material from transforming into heavier elements. A 
                major difficulty of star seeding is that it is very time consuming. Civilizations do not have the time to 
                wait for a star to die. To work around this issue, they increase the amount of energy within a star to 
                increase its rate of fuel burning. Due to this process having the potential to convert the star into a black 
                hole (which means the loss of the starting materials), "low" ammounts of energy are added. This lengthens the 
                process dramatically, resulting in the process taking between one to three years to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the star is ready to explode, a blast shield is contained by a shell of energy which encases the entire 
                star system. The shield itself typically has more energy than the star's potential energy. This dictates that 
                only advanced civilizations can attempt star seeding/forging. Once the blast is completed, the area must cool 
                down for a minimum of 6.4 galactic years (Approximately 8 Terran years). It can be cooled down faster through
                the use of varying technologies. The UE uses Arctic Bombs to cool the area, usually reducing the time required
                down to 3 Terran months. The Skivs most likely used technology to alter the time in which the space experienced,
                possibly making it take less than a Terran hour for the cooling process to complete. After the space has been 
                cooled, material collection can begin. The material can be harvested through various means. The UE uses nanite
                swarms and the Xelans use large energy nets. The Skivs most likely used either their psionic manipulation, or 
                some technology that attracts atoms towards certain locations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As stated previously, star seeding is a type of forging and can be used for alloying materials that typically 
                can not be alloyed. Certain types of alloys can only be outputted using star forging. Stellar steel is the output
                of Iron and Carbon. Other alloys can be made, however, they do not parallel the extremee effectiveness of Stellar
                Steel. The UE commonly creates Stellar Tungstensteel. It is a stronger form of Tungstensteel (which is made from 
                steel and tungsten), as it uses Stellar Steel, rather than steel. Schrabidium, Element 126, is the first island of 
                stabilty and is used very frequently by The Empire. It is can be created rather quickly, and does not require star 
                seeding, however it can create large quantities of it faster than any other method. Plasteel is a combination of 
                plastanium (created from titanium) and steel. It can only be forged from star seeding, due to the gravitational 
                requirements needed for its creation.
