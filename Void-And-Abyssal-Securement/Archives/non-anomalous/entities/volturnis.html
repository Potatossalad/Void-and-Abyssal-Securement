            <h2>The Volturnis</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Name:</strong>
                Volturnis
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong>
                They are the Precursor Race of Humans. Very little information is known about 
                them, however their discovered DNA matches 99% to that of the human genome,
                with very slight DNA changes. These changes most likely cause an increase in 
                their intelligence, and their lack of aging. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Their existence was unearthed from a structure found within the core of Terra
                (Earth, for those in another timeline). This structure houses the <u>Theorem of 
                Earth</u>, the <u>Theorem of Life</u>, and the <u>Continuous Theorem</u>. It is how we learned 
                that they had technology or divinity that could alter fate. 
            </p>

                <strong>Technology:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        They had Interstellar Travel Systems. Whilst not ships like we are used to,
                        they had large gateways, fueled by quantum properties. It appears they had 
                        a form of technology for large gaps in space along with these gates, as
                        their homeworld was found 4.543 billion light years away, the age of Earth
                        (as of this time).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They had technology that could alter Fate itself (see above). The properties 
                        the theorems are mostly unknown, but the known information will be simplified.
                        <br><br><strong><u>The Theorem of Earth</u></strong>
                        states that Terra/Earth, upon complete destruction, will be completely remade,
                        resembling the last stable period of life.
                        <br><br><strong><u>The Theorem of Life</u></strong>
                        states that whenever life on Earth/Terra is destroyed, it will activate The 
                        Theorem of Earth, as well as boosting the time speed of the planet until 
                        intelligent life redevelops. It also activates upon completion of the Theorem 
                        of Earth. 
                        <br><br><strong><u>The Continuous Theorem</u></strong>
                        essentially dictates that where ever pieces of the sanctuary (the structure in
                        the core), will also undergo the Theorem of Earth. Pieces of the sanctuary are 
                        on in Luna, as well as the Sun. The Volturnis species did not exist in the
                        <a href="../../../[CLASSIFIED]/Supra/basic_briefing.html">Supra</a> universe.
                        <br><br>
                        This activation is also differed. If Luna or Sol were to be destroyed, only that
                        body will be reformed (Though if Sol dies, Terra also dies because of the nova). 
                        Upon the destruction of Terra, both Sol and Luna will also reform, but won't 
                        reform in a Theorem of Life scenario.

                        They possessed extended knowledge on quantum properties. Within the Sanctuary 
                        were 2 gates (explained above). The gates were octogonal in design. These gates 
                        were supplied ith a "Quantum Liquid".When the gates were powered (through usage 
                        of cables, as power could not betransmitted wirelessly into it), the gates 
                        activated. The area inside turned into a purple array. Anything that paassed 
                        through one gate, would appear throught the opposite gate (like a Portal Gun).

                    <strong>Precursor Race:</strong>
                    A Precursor Race is a species, alien or not, that formed another species. This term 
                    is given one of two ays. The first way, is when the Precursor engineered the new race,
                    usually genetically. The second way is if the new species is the last remnant of the 
                    precursor, the possibility of the races meeting each other is rare, if not impossible.

                    <strong>Quantum Liquid:</strong>
                    Composed of the possible instances of a liquid. The liquid itself is unknown, however 
                    it can be instantiated into any other liquid, the energy requirements getting higher 
                    depending on the amount of bonds and elements that the liquid has. It is frequently 
                    instantiated into water and liquid naquadah within the UE (the pool in the Sanctuary
                    is seemingly neverending).
