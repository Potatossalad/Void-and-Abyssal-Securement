            <p>
                A hood hides most facial features. It is unknown if the hood is of biological origin.<br><br>

                Adorning their face is a pair of 6 eyes.
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pair for general sight</li>
                    <li>1 pair presumably for infrared vision due to their vast knowledge of thermal conductivity.</li>
                    <li>The last pair's purpose is unknown, though, it is theorized that it is either a second set of eyes for general sight or for psionic manipulation</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                2 sets of arms
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first set's hands is fixed in a downwards strike position. This is most likely due to it only being used to assist in their preferred combat style.</li>
                    <li>The second set is on average 3 to 13cm longer than the first set.</li>
                    <li>The hands of all arms have 3 fingers and are opposable</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their bones are harder than steel and have exoskeleton-like skin, as hard as iron.</li>
                <li>They are impossibly strong and are physically artificially enhanced, as well as showing signs of being genetically modified.</li>

            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                During a routine Mars mission, the ship burned up around 26km early of the estimated distance for burn up during planetary entry. After 3 more (unmanned) attempts with the same result, a thermal imaging probe was sent.<br><br>

                The probe launched from the ship 40km before the affected area and started a deep scan. Upon viewing the visual feed, an area around 16km large was completely devoid of heat (0°K). Due to the lack of heat, it was dubbed the "null area".<br><br>

                The transfer ship (which disengaged thrusters after the probe launched) drifted towards the null area. Upon entering 2km of said area, the ship incinerated and the probe recorded a massive spike in temperature, equalling the surface of the sun.<br><br>

                Due to this strange discovery, a new plan was made: Cool it down.<br><br>

                Humanity, now with a common goal in mind, started to disable all military operations globally and dismantle all weapons. The technology used for energy weapons was then used to cool things to insanely low temperatures.<br><br>

                A factory was built on the Moon's south pole due to it being the coldest place in the solar system (25°K). The hope was to have machinery already close to absolute zero and remain very cold on their voyage to designated spots. <br><br>

                The plan for the cooling of the null area was to have thousands of ships, armed with cooling rays cool the area. If a ship’s ray were to fail, it would be ordered to fall into the null area and engage its internal cryo-crystal at the slightest increase in heat, at which point it will take 5 seconds to activate and freeze ~700m of area alongside it (Protocol 4 - Freeze Failure).<br><br>

                After 6 years of development, the plan was set into motion. After another 8 years of construction, and 7 years of moving all ships into the correct space, the signal to engage freezing was given. With an energy consumption rate of 18 terawatts/s, the thermal imaging probe observed temperatures that rivaled the estimated heat of the sun’s core (15,000,000°K).<br><br>

                A seemingly impossible anomaly was sitting right in the sol system. With this, a scare in the scientific community arose. What made it possible for another star to be orbiting Mars?<br><br>

                An order was given to the cooling ships to disengage, but the onboard AI of every single ship did not comply. En masse, every ship engaged Protocol 4 and dove straight in. Executives freaked out because so much material would be lost, due to this failure, but the thermal imaging probe captured something curious, As the final ship had entered the area, it no longer incinerated. It barely even heated up. From the command center between Earth and Mars, the ship could be observed smacking into a solid surface and shattering due to the ship's severely low temperature.<br><br>

                A communication ship was sent out to the strange anomalous ship. The ship opened a massive entrance for the communication ship. Upon entering the ship, a massive energy wave closed the entrance, causing an airlock effect. The atmosphere of the ship was sterilized and changed for human needs. The communication crew shouted out, hoping for the aliens to take them to the captain of the ship, yet no alien came out. The ship was eerily quiet, only the hissing of the valve’s opening as the ship adapted to human requirements. The communication crew called for researchers, scientists, and engineers, as there were no signs of the aliens anywhere.<br><br>

                As the engineers and researchers rolled in, a biologist spotted what appeared to be a pod of some sort. Humanity, being eager for the unknown, decided to open the pod, without putting up a quarantine area. This however was not a problem, the pod was deeply sterilized when it opened, and inside was an alien, now codenamed “Skivs”. The biology section of humanity took to this alien and broke down every bit of it. The engineers aboard the ship started to dismantle what looked like non-vital parts of the ship to understand what it was made out of.<br><br>

                Researchers soon found their way to what can only be assumed to be the alien's medical section. They informed the biologists, who then moved into said medical section. The researchers kept moving until they found the cockpit. Its instruments were engraved with a foreign language, and no way to control said instruments was found. Biologists concluded that some part of either the Skivs’ brain or eyes moved the instruments.<br><br>

                A log file was found aboard the ship. The researchers and scientists then worked on translating the Skivs language. While the log was translated quite poorly, it was still possible to understand the basic idea of the log. The Skivs were highly intelligent and seeded their home star with material. They then caused their star to go supernova, to release said material. This material was dubbed “Stellar Steel” by the research team. Stellar steel was steel made of carbon and iron used in seeding a star. Its heat tolerance and conductivity allowed it to survive entering a star. Stellar Steel was used for their ships, and it is unknown how many stars were seeded just to get one ship.<br><br>

                The Skivs universe map shows that their home star existed far past the observable universe, showing that they indeed had faster-than-light technology, and were also an extragalactic civilization.<br><br>

                The communications team stumbled upon what could only be described as the Skivs message delivery system. A chamber, that somehow altered the time of the message container, shot the container into space at speeds possibly even 10x the speed of light. The message always arrived exactly 10 seconds after launch, regardless of distance. The ship receiving the message unfurled a massive web taking exactly 10 seconds to fully unfurl. This massive web caught the supraliminal container and decoded it into the ship's database. <br><br>

                A container that was about to launch but never did was pulled out of the chamber. It stated that this ship was exiting the conflict on XZER-l12 (for the civil war) slower than normal, and the ship was about to enter a star. The research team theorized that due to the high thermal conductivity and tolerance of the material the ship was made out of, the ship completely absorbed the star, but the Skivs could not handle the temperature of the ship and simply got incinerated.<br><br>

                The engineering team broke down a wall and discovered the ground weaponry of the Skivs. Massive polearms larger than 2 meters were inside. Each one is made of Stellar Steel, and Seeded Uranium (uranium from a seeded star). The crew tried to lift one of the weapons but their legs buckled almost instantly and they toppled into a wall. The biologists concluded that Skivs enhanced themselves in some way to be able to lift the insanely dense and heavy weaponry enough to have it used in commonplace during their wars.<br><br>
