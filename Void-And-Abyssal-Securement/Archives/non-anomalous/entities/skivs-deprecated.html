                Observable physical description:<br><br>

                A hood hides most facial features. It is unknown if the hood is of biological origin.<br><br>

                Adorning their face is a pair of 6 eyes.
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pair for general sight</li>
                    <li>1 pair presumably for infrared vision due to their vast knowledge of thermal conductivity.</li>
                    <li>The last pair's purpose is unknown, though, it is theorized that it is either a second set of eyes for general sight or for psionic manipulation</li>
                </ul>
                2 sets of arms
                <ul>
                    <li>The first set's hands is fixed in a downwards strike position. This is most likely due to it only being used to assist in their preferred combat style.</li>
                    <li>The second set is on average 3 to 13cm longer than the first set.</li>
                    <li>The hands of all arms have 3 fingers and are opposable</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Their bones are harder than steel and have exoskeleton-like skin, as hard as iron.</li>
                <li>They are impossibly strong and are physically artificially enhanced, as well as showing signs of being genetically modified.</li>
            </ul>
