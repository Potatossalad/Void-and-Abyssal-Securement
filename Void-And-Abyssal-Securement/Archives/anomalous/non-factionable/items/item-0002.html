                <strong>Description:</strong>
                It is a small, red pill. When consumed, all pleasure the consumer feels 
                is converted into pain. This conversion happens at a b(400)x^(2+b) of the pleasure
                caused, in which b is the amount of pills consumed. This means, that it scales 
                exponentially to the amount of pills consumed. Along with inflicting pain, the 
                amount of power the user receives is the same amount multiplication of pain, 
                multiplied with their remaining energy. It is a massive increase of power, however 
                it will kill the user quite fast unless used with 
                <a href="./item-0001.html">Item-0001</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon consumption of both Item-0001 and Item-0002, the pleasure and pain caused
                by both are cancelled out. However the energy multiplicity from pain and pleasure
                creation are still accounted for, causing an infinite increase in energy at the speed
                the cells can die. The cells are then revived instantaneously causing a never ending
                increase in power, until the pills effects wear off, in approximately 4 minutes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When either pill are taken at less then their full amount, the user feels a large 
                increase in lethargy, and undergo cyclicodelic affects, however with a strong high 
                instead of weak. They will not feel pain or pleasure, but their bodily will get 
                continuously weaker due to the draining of nutrients. This nutrience drain will 
                continue until the consumer either wakes up from the drug, or until they are deceased.
