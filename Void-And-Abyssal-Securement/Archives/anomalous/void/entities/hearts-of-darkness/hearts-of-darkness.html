            <h3>Fluid Membrane</h3>
            <p>
                The fluid membrane is the space between the plates along the Heart. 
                It is the lightest colored part of the entity and it pulses an electric 
                blue when in dark areas. It is described to be slimy to the touch. It is
                more viscous than water, but less than syrup. 
            </p>
            <h3>Plates</h3>
            <p>
                The plates are very hard and are chitin like in material. The are an 
                extremely dark color, typically looking black, brown, or dark maroon.
                They are coated in an acid, the specific type is unknown, however it is 
                very corrosive, and can dissolve most materials. This acid allows the 
                heart to consume nutrients. The plates form in irregular patterns, 
                and are [VOID STONE] in material. 
            </p>

            <h3>Support Fibers</h3>
            <p>
                The support fibers act like cables keeping the Heart upright. They 
                having a slimy protective liquid, with a structural feeling comparable
                to that of tendon. 
            </p>
            <h2>C.</h2>

            <h3>Petals?</h3>
            <p>
                These are a leafy bed grown from the bottom of the Heart. The leaves are 
                covered in tiny microneedles, however it pierces no material, and secretes 
                no liquid. It is possible that this is a vestigial structure of a previous 
                ancestor. 
            </p>

            <h3>Roots</h3>
            <p>
                The roots of the heart act like a mycelial network for the [HIVE]. The
                growth of the roots is uncontained, however it appears to not exceed 2 
                meters from the host Heart. These roots can also absorb nutrients through 
                the ground, however, it appears to only extract water and no other resources
                unless in a deficit for the plates to feed upon. 
            </p>

            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <p>
                The roots of the Hearts have a tendency to heavily infest certain areas of
                the ground. This infested ground has a fleshy, mushy texture. Standing within 
                an infested area for too long leads to [HIVE INFECTION]. It is recommended to 
                avoid these areas. Along with this, special strands of the support fibers form 
                and lengthen, until it reaches a separate area. This bridges the two areas, and 
                allows for the spread of more Hearts. The second image depicts an unknown city
                overrun with the Hearts. It has been quarantined and the effects of the hive 
                infection are being watched on the civilians previously living in the city.
