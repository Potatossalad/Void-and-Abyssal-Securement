            <h2>Void And Abyssal Securement</h2>
            <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
            <p>
                We are a collective Mult-Ultraversal group built on containing Void and Abyssal Entities. Due to the large 
                presence we have within the Godsverses, we have also become curators of humanity's knowledge. We remain 
                unknown to the worlds government until they achieve interstellar travel. It's been observed that a 
                civilization it is unlikely for a united people to not exist once achieving interstellar travel. 
            </p>
            <h3>Why Not Soul Entities?</h3>
            <p>
                The Soul Pressure exerted by soul entities make it so we can not even attempt to get close to them, 
                preventing us from containing them. They also have no abilities that can not be replicated with Resonance.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Do We Exist?</h3>
            <p>
                Many worlds have been destroyed due to Void and Abyssal entities, and there is much to be learned from their
                abilities. The ability to travel through the void, to teleport, to ascend planes. These abilities have all
                been unlocked and achieved by humanity through our efforts. 
            </p>
            <h3>What is your main timeline?</h3>
            <p>
                The headquarters occurs at 80085 terran years, Project Supra universe. This expirement caused the Abyss to 
                become curious, and as such we had to defend ourselves. 
            </p>
            <h3>How is VAAS pronounced</h3>
            <p>
                It is an acronym, not an initialism. It is pronounced like Voss.
