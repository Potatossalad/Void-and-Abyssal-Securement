            <h2>Intelligence Scales</h2>
            <p>Non-sentient = No thinking mind.</p>
            <p>Sentient = A thinking mind capable of forming and responding to emotion.</p>
            <p>Sapient = A thinking mind, capable of pondering things unnecessary for survival.</p>
            <p>Human = Intelligence is that of a human.</p>
            <p>Greater than human = Elevated levels of intelligence than that of a human. The range starts from that of Einstein's level of intelligence and extends to ~400IQ. Some humans have achieved this level.</p>
            <p>Severe = Capable of performing all human math problems within their head. An estimated starting IQ of 400+. A singular human has achieved this level of intelligence: <strong>Pilot-1729.</strong></p>
            <p>Severe* = Hyper-intelligence considered unfathomable. IQ of 1500+. The most well-known species to fit this description are the <a href="../Archives/non-anomalous/entities/skivs.html">The Skivs</a>.</p>
            <h2>Important information</h2>
            <p>As intelligence increases, violent tendencies increase, despite popular belief of the contrary. The reason for this cause is unknown. Popular belief for the contrary is spawned by a majority of the intelligent humans tend to be benevolent, however this is due to neurodivergency, and is not a normal phenomena within the galaxy. This is why corrupt individuals tend to dominate industries. They were intelligence, and the curse of intelligence drives the need to cause misery. </p>
