            <p>Atoms exist within Universes.</p>
            <p>Universes exist within Multiverses. An infinite amount of Universes can exist within a Multiverse.</p>
            <p>Multiverses exist within Hyperverses. An infinite number of Multiverses can exist within a Hyperverse.</p>
            <p>Hyperverses exist within Omniverses. An infinite number of Hyperverses can exist within an Omniverse.</p>
            <p>Omniverses exist within Ultraverses. An infinite number of Omniverses can exist within an Ultraverse.</p>
            <p>Ultraverses exist within the Godsverse. Only <em><strong>6 Ultraverses</strong></em> can exist within the Godsverse.</p>
            <p>Verses are considered extra dimensional. If it were to be rendered within the 3rd Dimension, the X verse existing within the Y verse would look like atoms within it.</p>
            <h2>The Godsverse</h2>
            <p>Only 1 Godsverse can exist at any single time. Every 'Verse' within the Godsverse must have its core destroyed for the Godsverse to be destroyed. This however, can happen within the same instance. In order for a new Godsverse to form, the previous Godsverse must be destroyed. We are on Godsverse 6.</p>
