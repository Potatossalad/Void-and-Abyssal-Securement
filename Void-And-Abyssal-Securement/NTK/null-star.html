            <p>
                <strong>Reason for importance:</strong>
                The reason for this file residing within NTK rather than Anomalous is due to Resonance being within a majority of all machinery.

                <strong>Description:</strong>
                The Null Star is a star in which all of its atoms are <a href="https://beyond-universe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Box">Boxes</a>.
                These atoms are observed to be either dead universes or completely devoid of life.
                The star appears to release an infinite number of these atoms that start to decay after reaching around two thousand AU. It is therefore, the only <em>naturally</em>
                existing <a href="https://beyond-universe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Megabox">Megabox</a>.
            </p>

                It is the Alpha Centauri System. It is unclear why the astronomical community decided to hide the Null Star's existence.
                When viewed from Terra, it does appear to be a trinary system. This however, is due to the particle spewing pattern of the Null Star.

                <strong>Properties</strong>
                The particles it is made out of have a special property. They all resonate at a frequency that is either unkown or is impossible to replicate. 
                This frequency, however, allows the particles to have infinite energy input and output. These particles are referred to as Resonance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the extreme mass of the atoms, it is possible to alloy them. There currently exists 1 alloy of Resonance, and is dubbed "Resonating Alloy".
                It consists of equal parts Pyrotheum and Cryotheum, 39% Copper, and 1% Resonance.
