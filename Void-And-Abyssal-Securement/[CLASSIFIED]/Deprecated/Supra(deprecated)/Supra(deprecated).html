            <h1>PROJECT SUPRA</h1>
            <p>Attached are four files.</p>
            <h2>File:Project_Supra</h2>
              <p>Project Supra was the attempt at faster than light travel. It was a catastrophic event, and no plans for FTL should happen anytime soon unless in a neighboring star system.
                The Anti-Material Drive (A.M.D.) was our ticket to FTL travel. It allowed us access to the Anti-Material Plane (A.M.P.), a place where the speed of light was the bare minimum. To access it, an object must be traveling at the speed of light, and then engage the A.M.D., at which point one will enter it.
                To exit the A.M.P., the object must revert its speed to 0 m/s instantaneously. This is because time dilation will occur when steadily slowing down, meaning Command may not know of the mission after a stable speed is met. Because of this requirement, the only means of slowing down is through the Kinetic Drive.
                Created from a resonating alloy [REFERENCE NULL STAR FILE], it can store infinite potential energy, as well as insert and exert all potential energy into and away from itself. This allows the ship to hit absolute zero particle movement, and then jump into orbital speeds, which will be calculated by the onboard AI.

            <h2>File:Ship_Components</h2>
            <p>Hydroponics Bay - Artificial Farm for deep space colonization.<br>
                Water Treatment Bay - Clean excrements for reuse.<br>
                Electrical Systems - All ships electrical wiring.<br>
                Solar Panels - For use when orbiting a star system.<br>
                Fusion Reactor - For use when fission fuel runs out. It will also make fission fuels as a byproduct.<br>
                Fission Reactor - For use when outside the range of Solar Panels.<br>
                Asteroid Mining Station - Docks the ship on an asteroid and begins to mine. Repairs ship and enriches minerals for fission fuel.<br>
                Thrusters - The ships primary way of getting to light speed.<br>
                Explosion Core - ONLY USED ON HIGHLY ADVANCED ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS. THROTTLES SHIP INTO LIGHT SPEED, BUT RELEASES ENOUGH ENERGY TO VAPORIZE A STAR.<br>
                Anti-Material Drive - Access to the A.M.P.<br>
                Kinetic Drive - Exit out of A.M.P. Also returns the ship to orbiting speed.<br>
                Auto Administered Sedatives - Due to the unknown affects the A.M.P. has on consciousness, these are used to render crew members unconscious while the ship is in the A.M.P.<br>

            <h2>File:Survivor_Log</h2>
            <p>Sent from Mars Colony<br>
                Currently 3 days after Supra launched and all hell broke loose. God, I knew we messed with something we shouldn't have.<br><br>
                From the looks of it, Supra launched with way more energy than it should have.<br><br>
                Reports from scientists on Earth state that the Earth's entire magnetosphere was completely obliterated, and that Luna shattered and now fragments are falling back down to the Earth.<br><br>
                Observations from the Ceres station show that:<br>
                A hole was punched right through Jupiter, the mass seemingly stopped existing.<br>
                Saturn became extremely hot, with a red glow emanating from it, visible in the night sky.<br>
                Uranus somehow became a nova, and did not destroy anything. Due to the extreme amount of gravity readings, it may form a blackhole in Uranus's previous orbit, with the same mass.<br>
                Neptune is gone. Nothing is left of it. No moons left scattered around the solar system. No gas scattered around the Kuiper belt. Just nothing. As if it didn't exist.<br><br>
                The Mercury station showed no increase in activity from the Sun.<br>
                The rovers on Venus show that the deadly atmosphere has completely cleared up, and it may become habitable again.<br><br>
                Here on Mars, an atmosphere has formed, and it's cold, dead, core has started heating up and moving again. Life may be possible.<br><br>
                2 factions have formed, one supporting FTL experimentation, and the other not.
