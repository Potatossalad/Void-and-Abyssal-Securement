            <h2>Meaning</h2>
            <p>
                An endless black void stands all around you. Looking ahead, you squint and see a note. You step a foot forward and step on solid, yet transparent ground. You keep walking towards the note. Finally reaching it, you pick it up and read over its contents.<br><br>
                "Within this realm, time itself fluctuates, particles form and disappear in random intervals. Stars are born and die. Creatures growl, yet nothing is there. It is a profound mix of terror, yet relaxation. Here, you will learn one thing, and only one thing. There Is Meaning in Unmeaning. No matter how distorted or messed up. There is a meaning in why something lacks meaning. You must learn to search for that meaning. It is difficult, so you will learn it here. You have all the time in the world."
