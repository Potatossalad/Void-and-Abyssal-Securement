            <h2>Basic Briefing</h2>
            <p>
                Project Supra was the attempt at faster than light travel (FTL). It was a catastrophic event, and no plans for FTL should happen anytime soon unless in a neighboring star system.<br><br>
                The Anti-Material Drive (A.M.D.) was our ticket to FTL travel. It allowed us access to the Anti-Material Plane (A.M.P.), a place where the speed of light was the bare minimum. To access it, an object must travel at the speed of light, and then engage the A.M.D., at which point one will enter it.<br><br>
                To exit the A.M.P., the object must revert its speed to 0 m/s instantaneously. This is because time dilation will occur when steadily slowing down, meaning Command may not know of the mission after a stable speed is met. Because of this requirement, the only means of slowing down is through the Kinetic Drive.<br><br>
                Created from a resonating alloy [REFERENCE NULL STAR FILE], it can store infinite potential energy, as well as insert and exert all potential energy into and away from itself. This allows the ship to hit absolute zero particle movement, and then jump into orbital speeds, which will be calculated by the onboard AI.
