            <h1>Ship Components</h1>
            <h2>Hydroponics Bay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lettuce</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
                <li>Kale</li>
                <li>Basil</li>
                <li>Mint</li>
                <li>Parsley</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Strawberries</li>
                <li>Sweet Potatoes</li>
                <li>Wheatgrass</li>
                <li>Algae</li>
                <li>Moss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wheatgrass, algae, and moss get their own secondary Hydroponics bay due to their usage as the air recycling system.</p>
            <h2>Water Treatment Bay</h2>
            <p>Has an external and internal module. The external module is designed for purifying water from crewmates excrements, as well as asteroid ice. The internal module is used for collecting water from plants that drips through the Hydroponics bay. It is then cleaned and reused in the watering system.</p>
            <h2>Hangar Bay</h2>
            <p>The primary way of entering and exiting Flightcraft Supra.<br>
            Within the bay resides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 land rovers</li>
                <li>3 hover crafts</li>
                <li>6 portable generators</li>
                <li>Space suits for all crew members</li>
                <li>Small Spaceship Assembler</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Science Bay</h2>
            <p>Contains the Analysis Lab, as well as the ships fabricator.</p>
            <h2>Electrical Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Solar Panels. These are used when the ship is orbiting a star system. It allows all sections of the ship to run, and gives a little extra energy. </li>
                <li>Fusion Reactor. It is to be used when the fission fuel runs out. It is used during spaceflight, and creates fission fuels as a byproduct.</li>
                <li>Fission Reactor. It is used during spaceflight, as well as when outside the effective light level of the solar panels.</li>
                <li>Asteroid Mining Station. The ship will dock onto an asteroid, then begin to mine. It gives materials for the nanites to repair the ship, as well as providing fusion and fission material, depending on the composition of the asteroid.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Spaceflight Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ion Thrusters. These use energy in order to gain acceleration. This acceleration rate starts slow, however, it increases over time. To reach light speed it would take around a month to reach light speed.<br></li>
                <li>Flight Core. This outputs large amounts of energy that has a tendency to disrupt electrical fields. It reaches light speed in ~2 hours when parired with the thrusters. This combinantion is the primary way to reach light speed.<br></li>
                <li>Nova Arc Catalyst. It is to only be used when in the presence of aggressive civilizations or very extreme scenarios. It will throttle the ship into light speed in less than a picosecond, however, it releases enough energy to vaporize a small star. It is left trailing behind the ship, with an arc of lightning keeping it chained to the ship. When the situation calls for it to be activated, the ship launches a massive, and continuous beam of energy into the reactor, casusing the Matter-Antimatter reactor to start, which will cause the explosion. The initial balst pushes the ship into 99.999999983% the speed of light, and overcharges the thrusters from the released energy, which will accelerate it to light speed in less than a Planck time.<br></li>
                <li>Anti-Material Drive (AMD). This allows the ship to access the Anti-Material Plane (AMP). It tears apart space-time, in order to access the dimension, however, this hole only exists for a Planck time, which causes no serious repercussions to the integrity of the universe. <br></li>
                <li>Kinetic Drive. This allos the ship to exit out of the AMP and return to orbital speed. It is constructed out of Resonating alloy, and is in the form of a CD disk. It instantaneously brings the kinetic energy of the ship to zero (due to the properties of resonance), forcing it out of the AMP, then releases some energy to ensure the life of the crew members and movement of the ship. <br></li>
                <li>Shield Generator. This protects the ship from stray debris, matter, and Celestial bodies when in free space and the AMP, due to the high speed of the ship allowing for any obstructions to obliterate the ship.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Auto-Administered Sedatives. Due to the unknown effects of surpaliminal speeds, as well as the AMP, on consciousness, the crew members are rendered unconscious while the ship is travelling above 50% the speed of light and the AMP.</li>
            </ul>
