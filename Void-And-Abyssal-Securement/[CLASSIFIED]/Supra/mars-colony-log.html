        <h1>File sent from Aries Colony</h1>
        <h2>Video Log</h2>
        <p>
            "Alright, it's been three days since Supra has launched, and ohhh boy, things have gone to shit. God, I fuckin' knew we messed with thigns we shouldn't've." He chuckles then continues, "Well, from the looks of it, Supra launched with way more energy than it should have."<br><br>
            A new voice mumbles in "Fuckin' government probably tried to kill us all off so they could do all the fuckass shit they wanted."<br><br>
            "Shut the hell up right now Harold!" The original voice says. <br><br>"Who are you going to send this file to, hmmm John? We are probably the only humans left at this point", the now named Harold says.<br><br>
            "Dumbass, we literally got reports from Ceres station and the Venus Colony yesterday" John Says.<br><br>
            Harold replies, "Shiiiiit, you right."<br><br>
            "Now get your ass back to scanning that soil, we gotta find a way to farm before Pete eats everything" John scolds Harold.<br><br>
            Harold gives back a sarcastic retort, "Right away boss."<br><br>
            "I will sock 'Tilda on you"<br><br>
            "Right away supreme sir. I never should have  played around with you" Harold says, with a look of fear in his eyes, and then quickly leaves the room.<br><br>
            "Alright, now where was I? Oh right, Supra shit. I'll uhh, attach the logs I guess?", he then mumbles out "God, why did Chloe have to be sick, she's better at this log shit than me."

        <h2>Detail Log</h2>
        <h3>Mercury Station reports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sol shows no increase in activity.</li>
            <li>The average temperature on mercury increased by 50C on its sun facing side, and decreased by 50C on the not sun facing side.</li>
            <li>The atmosphere of Venus has been recreated, and now matches the atmospheric composition of Terra during the Carboniferous period.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Terra reports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Terra has lost its magnetosphere entirely.</li>
            <li>Luna has completely shattered and its fragments are now falling back down onto Terra.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Aries colony reports</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aries now has a larger magnetic field, as well as a thicker atmosphere.</li>
            <li>The core of Aries has now "warmed up", and the metal spread of the core can now enable a dynamo affect to create a stable magnetosphere.</li>
            <li>The increase in temperature due to the new atmosphere and magnetic field has melted ice near the equator, causing liquid water to be present at the surface, and not evaporate.</li>
            <li>The rotation of Aries has increased by a small margin and now aligns with a Terran day.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ceres Station report</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Jupiter has a hole within it. Matter scans indicate that no matter exists within the area of the whole, however the gases of Jupiter have not come to fill the hole, suggesting the existence of false matter being present.</li>
            <li>The surface temperature of Saturn has increased to approximately 2000C, whilst the temperature before was -140C</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The surface emanates an eerie red glow.</li>
                    <li>Saturn is no completely visible from any night sky, regardless of the perspective you are viewing. The causes for this effect are unknown.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Uranus has gone supernova, though it has not destroyed anything. Gravitation scans indicate the possibility of it collapsing into a blackhole. If this does occur, Uranus will be renamed to Caelus.</li>
            <li>Neptune is gone. There is nothing to look for. There are no scattered moons across the Solar System. There is no increased gases around the Kuiper belt. Gravitational readings show that no place along the path of Neptune emits gravity. Neptune simply does not exist anymore.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Along with these station reports, humanity has come to a predicament. Two new factions have formed. The Venus colony faction has the belief that FTL experimenting should not be attempted again, despite the heavy resource shortages, and the lack of material within the Solar System. The colonies on Aries, however, believes that FTL technologies should continue to be explored and experimented with. There is a popular consensus between all remaining humans that The Executives hiding within the asteroid belt were the most likely suspects to the malfunction of Supra's launch. They will not be revealed the Truth. Ever.
