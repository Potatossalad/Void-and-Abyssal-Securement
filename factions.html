                        These are extra-universal entities. These behave similar to

                        Almost all Celestials have been forgotten. The only remembered ones
                        are the Celestial of Insanity, the entity that was the greatest opposition
                        to [ZENOLOGIA STRAUYON], The Celestial of Energy, Arkus, who reforms the 
                        Godsverse when a majority of it is threatened. He has been the commandment 
                        of the Godsverse' reformation following Godsverse 3. The last remembered 
                        celestial is Kronos, the Celestial of Time. He fired the flawed [Arrow of Time].

                        A small fraction of celestial energy split from the condensed energy of the

                        Soul.

                        Higher beings exist with a Soul and lack the Abyssal Twin. The presence of only a 
                        soul allows them to bend the universe to their will, as the Soul exists only within the 
                        Universe. This exerted also enables the Higher beings to live on with their physical body
                        destroyed, as you must destroy or send away the Soul, away from the light of the Universe
                        as this is what allows their reformation.

                    Lower beings exist with an Abyssal Twin and lack a Soul. Due to lacking a soul existing within
                    the Universe, destroying the body of a lower being will result in its death. However, 
                    destroying the Abyssal Twin will not result in death, but rather a loss of sapience, due to the
                    mind being connected to either of the Souls.

                <h4>Middle Beings</h4>
                    <p class="factions-middle-p">
                        Middle beings are the most complicated type of beings. They exist with both an Abyssal Twin and
                        a Soul. This however, does not make them as strong as Higher beings. Rather, the Abyssal Twin 
                        counteracts the presence of the Soul, if that is the type of middle being they are. Due to the existence
                        of an Abyssal Twin, destroying the body of a middle being results in the Soul being united with the 
                        Abyssal Twin, resulting in [True Death].
                    </p>
                    <p class="factions-middle-p">
                        As stated previously, there are multiple types of middle beings. Most tend to follow the pattern of
                        both Souls existing at the same time. However, humans follow a different pattern. The beating of the heart
                        is the Soul existing, and the pause before another beat is the Abyssal Twin existing. They cannot exist at 
                        the same time. This means that if the Abyssal Twin is destroyed, the heart cannot complete its rhythm, 
                        resulting in death. However, this means that humans are the only beings capable of being revived. The 
                        Sanctuary of Soul allows for a ritual to let The Soul be the only needed Soul for existence. 
                        Entering the Abyssal plane to retrieve the Abyssal Twin when The Soul dies lets the Abyssal Twin fill the
                        empty soul within the physical plane, allowing for function, until either a new Soul is found or until the 
                        Ruins of the Abyss is found, to establish the Abyssal Twin as able to be truly functioning within the 
                        physical plane, as well as being the only needed Soul to function.
                    </p>
                    <p class="factions-middle-p">
                        Humans have the possiblity to unite the Souls without annhilation, however this has only been attempted and 
                        achieved by one person, [Pilot-1729]. The explanation is within their personnel file.

                    <p class="factions-abyss-p">
                        The Abyss exists outside the Godsverse. There were twelve Abyssal Titans, 
                        which encompassed the Godsverse like a clock. They each controlled a domain,
                        and the closer to the edge, the more the domains blended together. The known 
                        Titans were Faith, Emotion, Offense, Defense, Intelligence and Technology. 
                        The Titan of Emotion would mostly come to be known as the Titan of feear, as 
                        it is the strongest emotion, and was the only emotion that was able to be instilled
                        into the other Titans. The Titan of Emotion was the weakened form of [Creator Omnium].
                        The Titans would eventually come together and reforge Creator Omnium, where he would 
                        transcend, and begin to fight [THE SIX].

                    <p class="factions-abyss-p">
                        Like Celestials, the Abyss also had slivers of energy form into something new,
                        Resonance.

                    <p class="factions-resonance-p">
                        Resonance is a counterpart to Soul. It supresses Soul, however Soul supresses it. It also
                        animates things, like Soul, though, they are not living. The animation born from resonance 
                        results in artificial elongation and rotating geometric patterns, though not including circles and ovals. 
                        There is also another type of Resonance, 
                        made by the
                        <a class="factions-resonance-p" href="./Void-And-Abyssal-Securement/NTK/null-star.html">Null Star</a>
                        however, these two types are different, as the one from the Null Star is not
                        born out of the Abyss, but rather [Astral Tears].

                <p class="void-main-p">
                    Void stems from the interaction between the Abyss and Soul.
                    Void is the Abyss given soul. There are 3 main types, Corrupting, Pure, and True.

                    <p class="corrupting-void-p">
                        This is the main type of Void that V.A.A.S. contains. Corrupting void, like the name 
                        implies, corrupts. It converts biological entities into void entities, and warps 
                        landscapes into a Void Ecosystem. A Void Ecosystem is a collection of many entities 
                        assimilated by the Corrupting Void, and form a, well, ecosystem. This ecosystem lacks 
                        plant life, instead opting for fungal life forms. The animal life form consists of 
                        entities undergoing carcinization and parasites. The parasites are the main vector of 
                        spreading the corruption, able to infect many different lifeforms across dimensions, 
                        despite biological discrepancies and differences. The crustacean lifeforms defend the 
                        habitat.

                        This is the other type of void that V.A.A.S. contains. Pure void is much different 
                        from True void, despite the similarity in names. Pure void wishes to remain pure void 
                        energy. Similar to Corrupting void, it converts things within it to match the the type
                        of void. Rather than creating living ecosystem, it converts all material into a shiny,
                        silvery, void metal. This metal is composed entirely of Void Energy.
