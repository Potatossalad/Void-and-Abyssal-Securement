                    <p>
                        These are extra-universal entities. These behave similar to 
                        gods from mythologies, however they control
                        <a href="./Void-And-Abyssal-Securement/NTK/universe-organization.html">The Godsverse</a>
                        rather than a singular universe.

                    <p>
                        Almost all Celestials have been forgotten. The only remembered ones
                        are the Celestial of Insanity, the entity that was the greatest opposition
                        to [ZENOLOGIA STRAUYON], The Celestial of Energy, Arkus, who reforms the 
                        Godsverse when a majority of it is threatened. He has been the commandment 
                        of the Godsverse' reformation following Godsverse 3. The last remembered 
                        celestial is Kronos, the Celestial of Time. He fired the flawed [Arrow of Time].

                    <p>
                        A small fraction of celestial energy split from the condensed energy of the
                        time before [Planet Zero]. This split energy would become the most known animate, 
                        Soul.

                <h3>Soul</h3>
                    <p>
                        Soul was first spawned from stray celestial energy. It animates every entity, other
                        than those born of the Abyss. Their exists two types of soul, The Soul and the Abyssal 
                        Twin.

                <h4>Higher Beings</h4>
                    <p>
                        Higher beings exist with a Soul and lack the Abyssal Twin. The presence of only a 
                        soul allows them to bend the universe to their will, as the Soul exists only within the 
                        Universe. This exerted also enables the Higher beings to live on with their physical body
                        destroyed, as you must destroy or send away the Soul, away from the light of the Universe
                        as this is what allows their reformation.

                <h4>Lower Beings</h4>
                <p>
                    Lower beings exist with an Abyssal Twin and lack a Soul. Due to lacking a soul existing within
                    the Universe, destroying the body of a lower being will result in its death. However, 
                    destroying the Abyssal Twin will not result in death, but rather a loss of sapience, due to the
                    mind being connected to either of the Souls.
                </p>

                <h4>Middle Beings</h4>
                    <p>
                        Middle beings are the most complicated type of beings. They exist with both an Abyssal Twin and
                        a Soul. This however, does not make them as strong as Higher beings. Rather, the Abyssal Twin 
                        counteracts the presence of the Soul, if that is the type of middle being they are. Due to the existence
                        of an Abyssal Twin, destroying the body of a middle being results in the Soul being united with the 
                        Abyssal Twin, resulting in [True Death].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated previously, there are multiple types of middle beings. Most tend to follow the pattern of
                        both Souls existing at the same time. However, humans follow a different pattern. The beating of the heart
                        is the Soul existing, and the pause before another beat is the Abyssal Twin existing. They cannot exist at 
                        the same time. This means that if the Abyssal Twin is destroyed, the heart cannot complete its rhythm, 
                        resulting in death. However, this means that humans are the only beings capable of being revived. The 
                        Sanctuary of Soul allows for a ritual to let The Soul be the only needed Soul for existence. 
                        Entering the Abyssal plane to retrieve the Abyssal Twin when The Soul dies lets the Abyssal Twin fill the
                        empty soul within the physical plane, allowing for function, until either a new Soul is found or until the 
                        Ruins of the Abyss is found, to establish the Abyssal Twin as able to be truly functioning within the 
                        physical plane, as well as being the only needed Soul to function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humans have the possiblity to unite the Souls without annhilation, however this has only been attempted and 
                        achieved by one person, [Pilot-1729]. The explanation is within their personnel file.
